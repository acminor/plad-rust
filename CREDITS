These are the necessary attributions. I try to only attribute directly included packages (see Cargo.toml).
If this is an issue with package owners, please feel free to contact me on Gitlab (acminor).
For further copyright and attributions, see the included packages includes or install and
run Cargo license and check software from there. Also most licenses are taken from each
individuals project source if they include copyrights. Thus, hopefully these attribute the
right person. Otherwise, an appropriate copyright was attempted.

Earlier versions of this software used the Freetype library. (This is an execption to the above rule.)
