+ [x] Do fft and scaling locally at startup
  - fixes issue of misscaled fft
    (ie scaled fft is not normall with just 0 padding XD)
+ [ ] Fix the output format for inner product reduce
+ [o] Fix issue of having fft transform
+ [ ] Python plugins
  + [x] Plugin Loading
  + [x] Unix Domain Sockets [not anymore -ZeroMQ-] for low latency
    - did not really help much (hopefully rust will help some)
  + [ ] Rust Tokio/Future Capn Proto Plugin Manager
    + [ ] start python processes
    + [ ] predict using these
+ [ ] Investigate/email about proper microlensing generation
      (differences with my version vs NFD's)
    + [ ] NFD templates performed badly (why?)
    + [ ] only need to generate along one dim.
      + investigate effects and proper scaling
    + [ ] compress templates by looking at width measures properly
+ [ ] Investigate fft_r2c (seems to output onesided by default???)
+ [ ] Implement outlier removal and test
  + [ ] Basic average based outlier removal (>mean+3*stddev => remove)
    + what percentage of points are ignored if assume guassian distribution???
